% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the

% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks -
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
%
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with

% this:

%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2015 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}

\begin{abstract}
Different from source code clone detection, clone detection (similar code search) in binary executables faces big challenges due to the gigantic differences in the syntax and the structure of  binary code that result  from different configurations of compilers, architectures and OSs. Existing studies have proposed different categories of features for detecting binary code clones, including CFG structures, n-gram in CFG, input/output values, etc. In our previous study and the tool \tool, to mitigate the huge gaps in CFG structures due to different compilation scenarios, we propose a selective inlining technique to capture the complete function semantics by inlining relevant library and user-defined functions. However, only features of input/output values are considered in \tool. In this study, we propose to incorporate features from different categories (e.g., structural features and high-level semantic features) for accuracy improvement and emulation for efficiency improvement. We empirically compare our tool, \toolNew, with the pervious tool \tool~and the available state-of-the-art tools of binary code search in terms of search accuracy and performance. \xyx{Results show that \toolNew achieves significantly better accuracies than \tool for cross-architecture matching, cross-OS matching, cross-compiler matching and intra-compiler matching. Additionally, in the new task of matching binaries of forked projects, \toolNew also exhibits a better accuracy than the existing benchmark tool. Meanwhile, \toolNew takes less time than \tool during the process of matching.}
%However, developing an accurate and effective binary code search tool is challenging due to the gigantic syntax and structural differences in binaries resulted from different compilers, architectures and OSs.
%In this paper, we propose \tool --- a scalable and robust binary search engine supporting various architectures and OSs.
%The key contribution is a selective inlining technique to capture the complete function semantics by inlining relevant library and user-defined functions.
%In addition, architecture and OS neutral function filtering is proposed to dramatically reduce the irrelevant target functions.
%Besides, we introduce length variant partial traces to model binary functions in a program structure agnostic fashion.
%The experimental results show that \tool can find semantic similar functions across architecture and OS boundaries, even with the presence of program structure distortion, in a scalable manner. Using \tool, we also discovered a zero-day vulnerability in Adobe PDF Reader, a COTS binary.

% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEtitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext when the compsoc
% or transmag modes are not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected
% - because all conference papers position the abstract like regular
% papers do.
\IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynontitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc or transmag under a non-conference mode.



% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover

%\IEEEraisesectionheading{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}}
% Computer Society journal (but not conference!) papers do something unusual
% with the very first section heading (almost always called "Introduction").
% They place it ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls does not automatically do
% this for you, but you can achieve this effect with the provided
% \IEEEraisesectionheading{} command. Note the need to keep any \label that
% is to refer to the section immediately after \section in the above as
% \IEEEraisesectionheading puts \section within a raised box.




% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
%
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
%
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
%
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
%
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
%\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
%for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
%IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
